From our previous UML, which was simply a rough draft of what we planned on doing, we did not include mapping functions or the right structure. 
We had an idea that didnt work out so we had to change it into a room function as the main super class which extended the rest of the classes, including
move functions, fight functions, and health functions, as shown in the UML. When we finish the code that is the way we planned on doing it. Our structure stayed
somewhat stagnant, however the attributes and the constructors/methods changed as the way we had done it in the first UML diagram did not attend to all
the edge cases and other factors needed to make the code work.
